## Docker Images  
**Note: arm images does not contain NVENC or H.265 encoding**  
There are 4 types of images right now:  
* bionic - Based off Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic, supports full multi-arch images
* focal - Based off Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, currently only supports x86. ARM support coming soon
* alpine - Based off Alpine Linux, current only supports x86. ARM support coming soon
* batch - Based off the bionic images but adds in batch support (see below)  

### Docker Batch support
Basic usage for batch support is through here. /path/to/in is where you place your ingress videos and /path/to/out is where you get the converted videos  
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/in:/in -v /path/to/out:/out itachi1706/handbrake-multiarch:batch-bionic-rpi-armv7l
```

should you wish to actually define your own preset, you can do so by naming the preset "preset.json" in /path/to/settings, then run this bash command instead
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/in:/in -v /path/to/out:/out -v /path/to/settings:/settings itachi1706/handbrake-multiarch:batch-bionic-rpi-armv7l
```
